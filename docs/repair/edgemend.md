With the Edge Mend, you leave the hole as it is and finish off the edges so it doesnâ€™t unravel any further. Or you use the edge mend for a fraying edge of the sleeve or fraying collar. We recommend doing this with a wide [Buttonhole/Blanket Stitch](https://community.fixing.fashion/academy/basics/sewing#blanket-stitchbuttonhole-stitch) for more strength. You can find this stitch step by step in the [Basics](https://community.fixing.fashion/academy/basics/sewing#blanket-stitchbuttonhole-stitch), preferably not too tight or too close to the edges. A distance of 0.5mm to 1cm from the edge. Like below.
