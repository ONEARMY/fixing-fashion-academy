Darning is a repair technique where you create a woven patch over the hole or in the hole. In the Basics, we discuss what weaving is and how it is made. To bring your darning work to the next level you need to know what kind of weaving pattern you can use.

The more advanced you get, the more you can vary with weaving patterns. If the hole is in a pair of jeans it is nice to repair it with a twill weave, that matches the original weave. Or you can replace it with a different weave and go wild with a herringbone or a diamond weave. In the video, we do the most basic weave, called a plain weave. It is a great starting point.

If you want to bring your work to the next level. You can prepare cards with the coloured yarns you have and see what colour combination fits best with the colour of the garment. This avoids working on a darning job where you are eventually not happy with it, because you chose the wrong colours.
