A zipper repair requires more sewing skills. So in the video above we show you how to go around it :)
If you need a zipper replacement and it’s in a hoodie, a jacket or another oversized garment then you can also remove the zipper. This is for instance if you want to change your zipper hoodie into a normal hoodie. Or your jacket into an anorak. [Watch this video](https://youtu.be/watch?v=TnxGHRlevlQ?t=1161) at 19:20 if you do want to learn more about actually repairing it. 




You can try it out yourself, but you will need some patience. It can be tedious and you may want to throw your sewing machine out of the window when you are done. You will also need a zipper foot for your sewing machine unless you want to do it by hand. We would like to eventually provide a full video ourselves on zippers, but that needs a full video in itself. It is a big topic as there are many different zippers, ways to attach them and ways they could break. For instance, jeans need a different way of zipper replacement than jackets. In the video, we talk about the different zippers out there and the different situations where you do and don't need to replace the full zipper.

**The Coil Zipper** is the most common and regular zipper of all, it is also named the all-purpose zipper. The coil zipper is nylon-based and has a stitch line over the zip teeth/chain. From this zipper, we have three versions. Good to use for skirts, blouses, shirts and dresses.

**Vislon Zippers** are the plastic moulded on to the zipper lint and do well when using heavier material. The plastic ones are more for Jackets, Sweatshirts/hoodies, Sweaters, Coats and Parkas.

**Metal Zippers** are easily recognised by their metal teeth made from aluminium, nickel or brass. Both of these zipper options are very sturdy and do well when using heavier material. You can find them a lot in jeans and jeanswear or more heavy wear clothing.

### DONT replace the zipper if

- The zipper doesn’t run smoothly, use a pencil and mark it over the zipper. The graphite will help the zipper to run smoothly. If not you can always buy zipper oil which will help the zipper run smoothly.
- The zipper doesn’t close behind the slide and it opens up again, it's mainly because the slider is worn out or bent.
- There are teeth out of a metal zipper, most of the time this happens in jeans. If this happens close to the bottom or top of the zipper chain, move the top or bottom by replacing the stop or the box. Unless the teeth are missing in the middle of the zipper, then I would recommend replacing the whole zipper. You can try to replace the top or bottom, but it might be that your jeans won't fit anymore or the zipper will be too far open to call it a functional closure.

### Replace the zipper if
- The lint next to the teeth/rails is ripped or broken.
- When the stitch of a Coil Zipper is damaged and unravels from the teeth/chain.
- When a few teeth of a Vislon zipper are melted or missing.
- When the box or the stops are broken or the end of the zipper is not finishing where it should be.
- When the metal teeth are missing on a place in the middle of the zipper, where you can’t replace the bottom or the top, because it will lose the function of the zipper.


### Components of a zipper.
Sometimes there is no need to replace the entire zipper, but perhaps just a part is broken. We show a few examples above. In this case, it's useful to understand the components in the zipper and what to replace. Below you can see the parts. If you replace a zipper and you know how to do it, be aware that you need to have the right zipper length, not the zipper lint length. And that you have Close-ended zippers and Open-ended zippers. If the zipper is used for a bag it needs a Close-ended Zipper that has a closed stop box or no finish at all. With a closed stop box, the zipper ends to that point and can’t be separated. Open-ended Zippers are more used in jackets or other garments where you need to go in and out of and where the slider can come off the rails and back on.
