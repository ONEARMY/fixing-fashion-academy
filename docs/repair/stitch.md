Depending on where the rip is, a stitch repair is recommended in the centre of the fabric. It is not suitable for rips in places where there is a lot of friction (ie. knees, elbows, shoulders, crotch or butt).
â€¨

### By hand VS machine
By hand, the stitch repair can be done with the [Ladder Stitch](https://community.fixing.fashion/academy/basics/sewing#ladder-stitch) for an invisible repair or when a seam is ripped. If you want a visible repair, use the [Overcast Stitch](https://community.fixing.fashion/academy/basics/sewing#overcast-stitch).
By machine, the [Zigzag stitch](https://community.fixing.fashion/academy/basics/sewing#stitches-by-machines) is commonly used if the rip is in the middle of the fabric. A [straight stitch](https://community.fixing.fashion/academy/basics/sewing#stitches-by-machines) is perfect for a ripped open seam. You can find these Stitches in the Academy [here](https://community.fixing.fashion/academy/basics/sewing#stitches-by-machines). If it is placed in the middle of the fabric. Or with a straight stitch when a seam is ripped open.
