|-------------|-------------|
|**1. Flat button** <br> The normal buttons we all know. They have 4 holes or 2 holes, which you can sew on by hand or by machine. If you do it too tight the thread will break again the next day. You need to be able to fit a layer of fabric between the garment and the button.| Jackets + blouses + Pyjamas |
| **2. Shank Buttons** <br> Shank buttons have a loop under the button itself, this helps create the space needed to fasten the button. These buttons are used for thicker coats and jackets. To attach it, place the button where you want to have it and sew it on with the [overcast stitch](https://community.fixing.fashion/academy/basics/sewing#overcast-stitch), by stitching over the loop. |Coats + thicker fabrics|
|**3. Jeans Button** <br> All jeanswear have these. The button has a nail where you pin or slam the button in and can hold thick layers of denim. |Jeanswear|
|**4. Snap Button** <br> The process looks a bit like placing a jeans button on. With this button style there is no sewing involved, all you need to do is slam it in with a hammer.| Jackets + Skirts|
|**5. Hook and Eye Fasteners** <br>These buttons are not very common anymore, but you can still see them on luxury women's wear. Mainly they are attached with the overcast stitch by stitching over the loops.|Bra + lingerie|
