A patch is a piece of fabric you can place over a rip or hole. This is necessary on places on the garment where there is movement and friction going on like the knees, elbow, crotch or butt and therefore needs a bit more strength.  â€¨



### Making a patch
Our favourite way of patching is making a patch out of fabric scraps or leftovers from other sewing projects. Keep a box of leftover fabrics as you can always reuse them for filling material or patches. There are only a few things to consider when selecting your patch material.

### Tips for patching
1. Every patch you add affects the garment. It is best to choose a patch material that is similar to the weight and characteristics of the garment you are repairing, especially when repairing a lightweight garment. This way the fit and comfort of the garment remains the same. For instance, when patching jeans, a piece of similarly strong and durable fabric, like canvas or denim is perfect. If you repair it with a lightweight fabric it can easily rip the next day again.
2. The best suitable patching material also depends on the location of the rip. For instance, if the rip is located where there is a lot of movement or friction and has a higher chance of ripping or fraying, your patch fabric should be strong to combat this.
3. When cutting a patch, it needs to be 2 to 3 cm bigger on both sides of the rip. If the whole area around the rip is quite thin and worn out then cut the patch, 2 to 3 cm around the worn-out area, to avoid ripping above the patch. Check in the video how to patch it and do it by machine with a Zigzag patch or by hand with the Sashiko technique.

> Note: Original Sashiko thread is 100% cotton and it is going to shrink a little when washed. The texture of the thread is a sashiko aesthetic. If the stitch becomes too tight the fit and the design will change and can cause the yarn to snap. Plus the repair won't look nice.


In the video, we explain the Zigzag repair. A patch by Machine placed underneath and stitched with a zigzag stitch. This can also be done with a straight stitch but requires more stitching. The zigzag repair is a way of repairing jeans and workwear and only woven fabrics. The straight stitch patch can be used as a decorative repair and can be placed in a pattern as you see in the picture.
