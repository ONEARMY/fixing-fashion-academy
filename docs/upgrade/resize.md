In this video we make some jeans longer with a jeans finish.
Resizing your garment is an incredibly useful skill. If you know how to do this, you can make anything your size, even your mum or dad's funky '60s clothes. So welcome to ‘Resizing’: the skill that makes everything wearable.

The most common way is to take excess fabric away and do this as invisible as possible. We like to do it a bit differently though. In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00skcH2lrfw) you see how you can do it visibly.

Resizing is also easily done by wrapping the garment differently and attaching it with a button. How this is done you can see in [this video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ncn4bCc0wcI)

Resizing a garment can be understood in many ways: making it shorter, longer, smaller or bigger and then doing that visibly or invisibly. Good ways to finish a garment when you make it shorter or longer, depends on what kind of clothing it is and what fabric it is made of.
