Remaking your clothes gives you the power to not throw away your full garment. With Remake, you can cut out the parts that you still like and use them to create a whole new garment.
A few things you need to keep an eye on when you want to Remake
- It is easier to combine clothing from the same size. One size difference is still okay to work with. But if you work with an XS and XL, you need to think about the fit that is drastically going to change.
- Clothing preferably is a size bigger than you wear as you take out 0.5cm to 1cm at every seam you draw.
- Always make sure to start pinning your new patterns from the top if one garment is longer than the other one.
- There are multiple varieties of combining clothing. The more complex your remake, the longer it takes to fully combine the garment and the smaller the shirt becomes.

A popular way to remake is to combine 2 pieces of clothes. Changing the function of the garment by adding something to it also falls under Remake. Adding functionality can mean that you add something to the garment that has a function, like pockets, a pencil holder or a loop to hook your keys on like we did in the video.
