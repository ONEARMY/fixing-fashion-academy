Even after a lot of caring and repairing, sometimes your clothes just need a bigger upgrade. Stains or rips could be too big to fix or you want to change up your style. The garment can still be used, so don't throw it out! There is a stage between recycling or swapping it. Of course, repairing the issue is the first step, but you can do a few more things before saying goodbye to it. Time to upgrade! You can Resize, Remake, Recolour or Decorate your clothes to give them a new and fresh look. We will break everything down further in these exact sections.

> Note: This is our first version of the Fixing Fashion Academy. We have many more topics and techniques to document, it will grow overtime. If you want to support us make sure to join [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/one_army).
