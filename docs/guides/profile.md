Hi welcome to the Fixing Fashion Community!

The project is still in early stages so good to see you here wanting to join. At the moment community members are dived in two different types: Members and Spaces. Members are individuals looking to connect and interact. Spaces are up and running and repair or upgrade clothes.  Here you can see the difference

This are the two layers we start of with. We will add more in the future as the project grows.
